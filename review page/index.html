					The fourth season features the arrival of new Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) and Lady Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin) starting her journey to becoming Princess Diana. Season 4 of The Crown is a perfect example of what the show does best. It is self-contained and finely wrought, a delicious hour in which each note strikes with the reliable, measured precision of a clock that keeps excellent time. It’s funny, sometimes wickedly so, with the sort of gossipy eye for detail that you want to slurp up greedily and then crow about as soon as it’s done. The shoes! The corgis! The party-game scene! It’s not always the most subtle — there’s little ambiguity in how the parallel tests plays out, and The Crown leans more toward big, obvious symbolism here than it does delicate nuance. But it’s gloriously entertaining and so absolutely, impeccably well made and well acted. I wouldn’t trade its conspicuous deer-stalking metaphor for anything.On one side, there’s Margaret Thatcher, played by Anderson with total relish and uncanny accuracy. Her wig alone is a marvel of the modern world. But Thatcher shines most brightly in every scene she shares with Colman’s Elizabeth, where they puzzle about one another and poke at their mutual prejudices and blind spots. On the other side, there’s the ascendant Diana, rushed into the scaffolding of a fairy-tale marriage that could never exist and gradually becoming an image of modern royal femininity that garners global applause even while she privately rages and suffers.

				After the events of Avengers: Endgame, Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) face new and old enemies. These two Avengers don’t always see eye-to-eye but have to figure out how to get along when they’re thrown into an unexpected mission. The Falcon and The Winter Soldier sets an impassioned tone that’s sure to make viewers connect with its characters, it also offers just the right amount of action. The segment with The Falcon is particularly well done, with an almost 10-minute long mid-air battle that would feel right at home in any Marvel movie. The action in the pilot is incredible but Marvel head honcho Kevin Feige and director Kari Skogland (“The Handmaid’s Tale”) are clearly aware that a successful feature isn’t just about big CGI set pieces. What makes Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes who they are and the struggle they both face is what drives the action in this series and that’s demonstrated in a pilot episode that’s perfectly balanced.

						The adaptation of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's fantasy novel of the same name where the End of the World is fast approaching and after many years of living with mortals, Aziraphale the angel (Michael Sheen) and Crowley the demon (David Tennant) decide they must stop the Apocalypse but first they must find the 11-year-old Antichrist (Sam Taylor Buck).The script is, unsurprisingly, annunciation-grade, luminously funny and strikingly poignant—and considering the principal characters include angels, demons and witches, (and a tween Antichrist) it’s as human as they come. The cinematic sensibility is something almost surreal. There’s Powell-and-Pressburgerish, deeply saturated, slightly hyperreal color and exquisitely weird visual imagery; there’s Gilliam-saluting surreal, and sometimes hammy, oddball cheekiness side by side with an arrow-to-the-heart sort of emotional honesty. And holy Hell (as it were), there’s an alarmingly gifted cast, including Hamm, Miranda Richardson, Michael McKean, Frances McDormand, Adria Arjona and Ned Dennehy for starters. But as good as everything is, as good as everyone is, the locus of this translation’s magic is the to-perish-for chemistry between Michael Sheen’s angel Aziraphale and David Tennant’s demon Crowley.
